"""# QScope Documentation

`Quantum Spin Control and Optics Programming Engine`

A (python) library for controlling physics experiments via script or GUI front-ends and a hardware/measurement server.
Currently implements spin defect measurements, in particular for widefield/camera-based experiments.

This documentation is organized according to the Di√°taxis framework:

- [Tutorials](docs/tutorials.html): Learn QScope through hands-on, step-by-step guides. Includes **installation** guide.
- [How-to Guides](docs/howto.html): Task-oriented guides for specific use cases.
- [Explanations](docs/explanation.html): Understand QScope's architecture and concepts.
- [Reference](#header-submodules): Detailed API documentation for QScope components.

As well as some additional items:

- [Hardware Support](docs/supportedhardware.html): Documentation for the hardware devices supported.
- [MPL documentation](docs/mpl.html): The CLI MPL docs are separate for now, due to its different architecture.
